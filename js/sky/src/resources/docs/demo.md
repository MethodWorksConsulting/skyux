summary: The resources constant and filter are available to localize SKY UX components.
---

The resources constant and filter allow you to localize SKY UX components. `bbResources` mostly applies to component development. When you build SKY UX and need to render a string, you can inject the `bbResources` constant. When you inject `bbResources`, all locale strings are available on the `bbResources` object and in a `bbResources` filter. You can view the available local strings  on the [SKY UX GitHub repo](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux/tree/master/js/sky/locales).
